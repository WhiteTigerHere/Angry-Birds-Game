# Angry Birds Game

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/libgdx/gdx-liftoff).
## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3; was called 'desktop' in older docs.
- `Gradle`: This project uses [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) to manage dependencies.

## Overview

This project is the static user interface (UI) for a bird-shooting inspired by games like "Angry Birds." The game features a catapult to shoot birds at a block structure containing pigs. The current implementation only includes the static UI elements without the actual gameplay mechanics.

This project is built using LibGDX as the main framework, and it demonstrates UI interaction with various elements like buttons, text fields, and dynamic screen navigation.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Java JDK 8+**: Ensure you have JDK installed. You can check your JDK version with:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

2. **Gradle**: Make sure Gradle is installed or use the included Gradle wrapper. You can verify the Gradle installation with:
   ```bash
   gradle -v
   ```

3. **LibGDX Setup**: The project uses the LibGDX framework. No additional setup is required for LibGDX as it is managed by Gradle dependencies.

### Setting Up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WhiteTigerHere/testgame.git
   cd foldername
   ```

2. **Import into your IDE**:
    - Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
    - Make sure the Gradle wrapper (`gradlew`) is configured properly.
    - Let the IDE resolve all dependencies by syncing Gradle.


3. **Build the Project**:
    - For **desktop** (LWJGL3), run the following command:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew desktop:build
      ```
      This will download all dependencies and compile the source code.

### Running the Game

To launch the game, run the following command for the desktop platform:

```bash
./gradlew lwjgl3:run
```

This will open the game in a desktop window with the static UI.

## Assets

- **Buttons**: Skin files for the buttons are loaded from `uiskin.json` (located in the `assets` folder).
- **Fonts**: The font used in the game is dynamically generated using `FreeTypeFontGenerator` and loaded from `ARIAL.TTF`.
- **Images**: Taken from google and Angry Birds Wiki website

## Future Improvements

- **Implement Gameplay**: Currently, only the static UI elements are implemented. The next step is to add gameplay mechanics like bird launching and projection, pig and structure destruction, managing collision and level progression.
- **Level Designs**: Each level will feature a unique combination of birds, pigs, and structures. This will be added in future iterations.
- **More Sound Effects**: Add sound effects for launching birds and breaking structures.
- **Gameplay Logic**: Adding physics-based interactions, bird launching, and collisions.
- **Level Progression**: Implementing level progression logic.
- **Scoring System**: Track and display scores dynamically.
